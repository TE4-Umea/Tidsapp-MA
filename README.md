# Timeapp-MA

We have created a time tracking app in Slack. Its purpose is the facilitation of organized and effective labour in workplace environments by tracking time spent working in general and on specific projects.
The app contains several commands, for both management and standard users, that, among other things, allow for the creation and configuration of teams and various projects as well as viewing valuable statistics concerning time spent working.
Python was used to create the application.
